# Baseball Playoff Predictions
## Modeling MLB team playoff chances based on team statistics and attributes
**Author:** Joshua Lensing
### Business Problem:
Major League Baseball data and analytics are becoming a very big component of how professional baseball teams operate. A lot of this dataset comes from the idea of "Moneyball," where Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland Athletics, found statisitics relating to individual player performance that scouts and other front offices were not focused on at the time. He hoped to use those background statistics and develop a formula for success that didn't require spending a large amount of money to build a roster of players. Instead, he hoped to find players that scored well in these statistical categories that other teams would often overlook and pay them cheaply to play for the Athletics. The hope was to ultimately make the playoffs and compete for a championship.
